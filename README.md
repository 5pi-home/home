*personal infrastructure for cloud native nerds*

- Kubernetes based personal infrastucture

Nothing to see yet. So far a collection of my own notes. Might eventually
generalize it to make it work for other cloud native nerds.

## Assumptions
## Site specific hacks
- use proxy-mode=userspace on openwrt so I don't have to deal with the iptables
  mess there
- kube-flannel.yml has interface on amd64 changes to br-lan
